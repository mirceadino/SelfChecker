# SelfChecker
Script to check the correctness of a source file (for competitive programming).<br/>

I wrote the script for self-use, but in fact anybody is free to use it or improve it. <br/>
I usually use the script in competitive programming problems when I implement a solution that I think is efficient in terms of execution time and memory, but I want to check if it gives correct answers all the time. So I implement a generator of random test cases with small input, a brute solution with bad complexity (but which surely gives good answers) and I run the script to check where my supposedly efficient source file fails in correctness.

### What you need to use the script:

1. A supposedly efficient C++ source file that you want if it is gives correct output (e.g.: file.cpp, J.cpp, aint.cpp)
2. A generator file named <b>generator.cpp</b> which generates input to be used in a test case (for the random seed, it should use clock(), as in srand(clock()).
3. A brute file named <b>brut.cpp</b> which correctly solves the problem (probably in a bad complexity, but at least it works).

### How to use it:

1. Put all files in one folder.
2. Run the terminal in the chosen folder.
3. Type <b>tester \<filename\> \<numberoftests\> </b> (e.g.: <i>tester file 10</i>, <i>tester J 100</i>, <i>tester aint 23</i>)
4. See where it fails.

<i>If everything is all right, it should look like this :-) </i>

### Some mentions:

- The "checker" will create a folder named "tests" in the chosen workspace which will contain the .in, .ok and .out files generated by the generator file, brute file and source file.
- Only standard input and output should be used for generator, brute and source files.
- It only works for C++ because this is my main language in competitive programming.
